    <p>hi im meowzzie <sup>they/he/she/</sup> i love living in my room like most ppl do and i also absolutely love animals (chickens included) <br>i honestly dont know what to put in this long paragraph so i think i should get started with stuff thats cool :3 <br>i hate using any other keyboard that doesnt look or feel like those ps/2 keyboards, i despise 40% keyboards, my main pc is from 2008 and i barely use my macbook knowing that its more powerful than any other pc money can buy from 2012-2013 <br>lain and bludgeoning angel dokuro-chan enjoyer, watched future diary when i was like 10 bc i thought it was a cute anime (it wasnt.) <br>ill listen to anything even to goreshit (love them literally and figuratively),i dont use spotify unless i want to give money to the ppl who made the awesome songs,not to ppl who reposted them unless the artist is problematic :o</p>
